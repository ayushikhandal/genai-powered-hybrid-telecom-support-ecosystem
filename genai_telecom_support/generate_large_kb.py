"""
Generate a large synthetic KB as JSONL entries.
Usage (PowerShell):
python generate_large_kb.py --out large_kb.jsonl --size-gb 1

This script streams entries to disk and won't keep the whole dataset in memory.
Each entry shape:
{
  "id": "kb-0000001",
  "category": "Billing|Network Outage|Plan Change|Device Problem|Account|Security|Provisioning|IoT|Enterprise",
  "provider": "jio|airtel|vodafone|vi|bsnl|others",
  "query": "user query text",
  "response": "concise suggested response",
  "tags": ["billing","refund","roaming"]
}

Note: This is a synthetic-data generator for demo and load-testing only.
